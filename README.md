# tf-tools

VS code extension to improve DevEx with Terraform 🚀

## Features

### Clickable resource/data tags

Terraform resource and data tags are annotated with links to the relevant documentation page in the Terraform Registry. The links are clickable with `CTRL + Click` on Windows/Linux or `⌘ + Click` on Mac, as demonstrated below.

URL links to specific provider publisher and version declared in the module context if applicable, otherwise they default to hashicorp/latest.
